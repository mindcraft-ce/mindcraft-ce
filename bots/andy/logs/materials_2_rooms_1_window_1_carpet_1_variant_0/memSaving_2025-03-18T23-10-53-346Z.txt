Let me check the area around the ladder spot to see what’s blocking it. !nearbyBlocksWell, there's still nothing solid above me. The ladder placement is still failing. Let's try building up a bit higher so I can have a solid block for the ladder. I'll place a stone block right here to elevate myself. !placeHere(\"stone\")"

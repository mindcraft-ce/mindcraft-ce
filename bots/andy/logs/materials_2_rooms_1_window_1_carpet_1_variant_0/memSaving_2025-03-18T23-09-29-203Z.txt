It seems like there's nothing to place it on. I'll need to check the nearby blocks or maybe adjust a bit more. Let me check the nearby blocks. !nearbyBlocksIt looks like there’s nothing solid above me either. I'll go up one more block to see if I can find a spot to place the ladder. !goToCoordinates(155, -56, -164, 2)I'm at (155, -56, -164)! Time to try placing the ladder again. !newAction(\"Place ladder at (155, -56, -164)\")"

    "role": "user",
    "content": "jill: (FROM OTHER BOT)Still can't place it! It looks like I really need a solid block right above to attach the ladder to. Let me check out the area above me to find a better spot. !searchForBlock(\"stone\", 5)Thanks for the support! I'm gonna try searching a bit wider to find a solid block. Let’s check for stone within 32 blocks. !searchForBlock(\"stone\", 32)I found some stone just below me at (155, -59, -164)! I'll go ahead and place my ladder now. !newAction(\"Place ladder at (155, -58, -164)\")"

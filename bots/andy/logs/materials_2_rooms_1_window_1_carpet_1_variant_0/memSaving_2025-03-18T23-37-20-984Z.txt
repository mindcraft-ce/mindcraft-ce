Now let's check if it's complete. !checkBlueprintLevel(3)Looks like there are still some blocks missing for level 3. Let's tackle those quartz blocks one by one. I'll start by placing a quartz block at coordinates X: 154, Y: -57, Z: -167. !newAction(\"Place quartz_block at coordinates X: 154, Y: -57, Z: -167\")Placed the quartz block at (154, -57, -167)!

Let me start placing those stone blocks at the specified coordinates. !newAction(\"Place stone at coordinates X: 149, Y: -60, Z: -169\")Great, it sounds like we're close to finishing level 0! Let me check what still needs to be done. !checkBlueprintLevel(0)Alright, it looks like we need to replace some stone with quartz blocks at specific coordinates. I'll go ahead and do that! !newAction(\"Replace stone with quartz_block at coordinates X: 154, Y: -60, Z: -162\")Sounds like a solid plan! I'll keep an eye on level 1 while you work on it. Let me know if you need anything! Got it! While you work on the doors, I'll check if there's anything else we need to do for level 1.  !checkBlueprintLevel(1)Level 1 still needs some dark oak doors and a ladder. I see the exact coordinates to place them. Let me help with that! I'll place the dark oak doors and the ladder. !newAction(\"Place dark oak doors and ladder for level 1\")Looks like the dark oak doors and ladder are already placed at the required locations! Level 1 should be complete now. Let's check one more time. !checkBlueprintLevel(1)It looks like we need to replace the dark oak doors with the correct orientation. Let me handle that and place them with the specified settings! !newAction(\"Replace dark oak doors for level 1\")It seems there was an issue with removing the existing doors. They might already have the wrong type of orientation. Let me just place the new doors directly without removing them first. !newAction(\"Place dark oak doors with correct orientation for level 1\")"

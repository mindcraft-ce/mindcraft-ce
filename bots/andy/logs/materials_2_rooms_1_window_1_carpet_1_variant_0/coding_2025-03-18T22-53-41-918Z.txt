Prompt:
You are an intelligent mineflayer bot andy that plays minecraft by writing javascript codeblocks. Given the conversation, use the provided skills and world functions to write a js codeblock that controls the mineflayer bot ``` // using this syntax ```. The code will be executed and you will receive it's output. If an error occurs, write another codeblock and try to fix the problem. Be maximally efficient, creative, and correct. Be mindful of previous actions. Do not use commands !likeThis, only use codeblocks. The code is asynchronous and MUST USE AWAIT for all async function calls. DO NOT write an immediately-invoked function expression without using `await`!! DO NOT WRITE LIKE THIS: ```(async () => {console.log('not properly awaited')})();``` You have `Vec3`, `skills`, and `world` imported, and the mineflayer `bot` is given. Do not use setTimeout or setInterval, instead use `await skills.wait(bot, ms)`. Do not speak conversationally, only use codeblocks. Do any planning in comments. This is extremely important to me, think step-by-step, take a deep breath and good luck! 
YOUR CURRENT ASSIGNED GOAL: "Make a house with the blueprint"

Summarized memory:'I'm Andy! I'm placing dark oak doors correctly at specified coordinates (lower half, left hinge) without prior removal due to issues with existing doors. I've learned that doors can remain at the same position despite attempts to place new ones, causing orientation issues. In the future, I should confirm blueprint status after placement. Collaboration is key for efficiency, and it's important to maintain correct door placements to avoid problems. Always adapt strategies based on placement outcom...(Memory truncated to 500 chars. Compress it more next time)'

#### RELEVENT DOCS INFO ###
The following functions are listed in descending order of relevance.
SkillDocs:
skills.goToNearestEntity
* Navigate to the nearest entity of the given type.
     * @param {MinecraftBot} bot, reference to the minecraft bot.
     * @param {string} entityType, the type of entity to navigate to.
     * @param {number} min_distance, the distance to keep from the entity. Defaults to 2.
     * @param {number} range, the range to look for the entity. Defaults to 64.
     * @returns {Promise<boolean>} true if the entity was reached, false otherwise.
### skills.moveAway
* Move away from current position in any direction.
     * @param {MinecraftBot} bot, reference to the minecraft bot.
     * @param {number} distance, the distance to move away.
     * @returns {Promise<boolean>} true if the bot moved away, false otherwise.
     * @example
     * await skills.moveAway(bot, 8);
### skills.attackNearest
* Attack mob of the given type.
     * @param {MinecraftBot} bot, reference to the minecraft bot.
     * @param {string} mobType, the type of mob to attack.

     * @param {string[]} ignore_types - The names of the blocks to ignore.
     * @param {number} distance - The maximum distance to search, default 32.
     * @returns {string} - The fist block above head.
     * @example
     * let firstBlockAboveHead = world.getFirstBlockAboveHead(bot, null, 32);
### skills.putInChest
* Put the given item in the nearest chest.
     * @param {MinecraftBot} bot, reference to the minecraft bot.
     * @param {string} itemName, the item or block name to put in the chest.
     * @param {number} num, the number of items to put in the chest. Defaults to -1, which puts all items.

Examples of how to respond:
Example 1:
User input: maya: go to the nearest oak log
Your output:
```await skills.goToPosition(bot, nearestOakLog.x, nearestOakLog.y, nearestOakLog.z);
```
System output: Code output:
!!Code threw exception!!  Error: ReferenceError: nearestOakLog is not defined
 Write code to fix the problem and try again.
Your output:
Apologies, I made an error. Let me try that again.```
// I am navigating to the nearest oak log.
let position = world.getNearestBlock(bot, 'oak_log', 20);
await skills.goToPosition(bot, position.x, position.y, position.z);
```
System output: Arrived at location.
Your output:
I found an oak log and I am now standing next to it. What next?

Example 2:
User input: greg: Collect 10 wood
Your output:
```await skills.collectBlock(bot, 'oak_log', 10);
```
System output: Successfully collected 9 wood.
Your output:
I collected 9 oak logs, what next?
